* What are we going to discuss?

** Spike trains

After a "rather heavy" pre-processing stage called *spike sorting*, the *raster plot* representing the spike trains can be built:

** Inter Spike Intervals (ISI)

#+BEGIN_CENTER
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.9\textwidth
[[file:imgs/locust20010214_Spontaneous_1_tetB_u1_7_isi_dens.png]]
#+END_CENTER

Estimated ISI densities of 7 neurons recorded simultaneously from the locust antennal lobe.

** Responses to stimulation 

#+BEGIN_CENTER
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.9\textwidth
[[file:imgs/locust20010214_C3H_1_tetB_u1_raster.png]]
#+END_CENTER

Raster plots from one of the neurons showing the responses to 25 presentations (gray background) of cis-3-hexen-1-ol.

#+END_CENTER

The observed counting processes associated with the 25 observed point processes just shown. In red the empirical mean of the 25.

** Modeling spike trains: Why and How?
- A key working hypothesis in Neurosciences states that the spikes' occurrence times, as opposed to their waveform are the only information carriers between brain region (Adrian and Zotterman, 1926).
- This hypothesis encourages the development of models whose goal is to predict the probability of occurrence of a spike at a given time, without *necessarily* considering the biophysical spike generation mechanisms.

* In defense of a modeling approach with a strong stochastic element 

** Purpose of this section
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_ENV: note
:END:

One could argue that dynamical systems are capable of generating highly variable outputs--just think of your favorite (pseudo-)random number generator, it's a deterministic system that does indeed generate numbers that look really random!--and that techniques adapted to fluctuating phenomena should not be employed.

There are, in my view, two answers to such a statement:
- One can decide that statistical methods are relevant because they provide a "usefull" summary of the observations. In the same spirit, describing a human population with statistical concepts implies that that in some aspect people are exchangeable but does not imply that humans are /always and in all aspects/ exchangeable; these tools provide usefull summaries upon which we can build.
- More fundemantally, what we know of neurons' biophysics, leads us to thing that there is /an intrisicly stochastic component in their dynamics/; that's the point made in this section.
