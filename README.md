# Course material for LASCON 2018

This repository contains data, slides, code, everything needed to "reproduce" my LASCON 2018 lectures and practical work.

# The outline (for now):

- **Making one's work reproducible**.
- **Basic statistics: sample description**.
- **Histograms: setting the bin width**.
- **Regressograms: setting the bin width**.
- **Fitting models to data: least squares and maximum likelihood**.
- **Application to Hodgkin and Huxley**.
- **Dealing with differential equations**.
- **Stochastic neuronal discharge models and their inference**.
